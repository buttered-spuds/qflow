# qflow

AI-orchestrated plug-and-play testing framework. Drop it into any project, connect your tools, and get UI + API testing with CI/CD integration, AI-generated tests, and results published to Slack, Teams, JIRA, and a GitHub Pages dashboard.

---

## How it works

```
JIRA ticket (acceptance criteria)
        │
        ▼
  Orchestrator Agent
    ├── JIRA Agent          reads/writes JIRA tickets
    ├── Generator Agent     LLM writes Playwright / API tests
    ├── Reviewer Agent      LLM scores test quality before they're committed
    ├── Runner Agent        thin wrapper around your test runner CLI
    └── Reporter Agent      posts results to Slack / Teams / JIRA + GitHub Pages
```

**Core principle:** Use scripts for deterministic work. Use AI only where reasoning is required.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Drop into an existing project
npx @qflow/cli init

# Run tests
npx @qflow/cli run

# Generate tests from a JIRA ticket
npx @qflow/cli generate --ticket PROJ-123

# View local dashboard
npx @qflow/cli dashboard
```

## CLI commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npx @qflow/cli init` | Interactive setup wizard — creates `framework.config.ts` and GitHub Actions workflow |
| `npx @qflow/cli run` | Run the test suite (default suite: `regression`) |
| `npx @qflow/cli run --suite smoke` | Run only `@smoke` tagged tests |
| `npx @qflow/cli run --suite pr-smart` | Smart test selection based on PR diff |
| `npx @qflow/cli run --local` | Run tests with no notifications or publishing |
| `npx @qflow/cli generate --ticket PROJ-123` | Generate tests from JIRA acceptance criteria |
| `npx @qflow/cli dashboard` | Local dashboard server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npx @qflow/cli costs` | LLM token usage and cost summary |
| `npx @qflow/cli flakiness` | Flakiness and quarantine status |
| `npx @qflow/cli coverage-check` | JIRA coverage drift report |

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in a single `framework.config.ts` at the root of your project. Run `npx @qflow/cli init` to generate it interactively, or copy [`framework.config.example.ts`](./framework.config.example.ts).

### Required secrets

Add these as GitHub Actions secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `QFLOW_JIRA_TOKEN` | JIRA API token |
| `QFLOW_JIRA_URL` | JIRA base URL |
| `QFLOW_LLM_API_KEY` | LLM provider API key (not needed for `github-copilot` or `ollama`) |
| `QFLOW_SLACK_WEBHOOK` | Slack incoming webhook URL |
| `QFLOW_TEAMS_WEBHOOK` | Microsoft Teams incoming webhook URL |

> **GitHub Copilot users:** set `provider: 'github-copilot'` and `apiKey: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN ?? ''` in `framework.config.ts`. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is injected automatically by GitHub Actions — no extra secret required.

> **Install globally** to use `qflow` as a direct command: `npm install -g @qflow/cli`

For local runs, create a `.env` file (gitignored) with the same variable names.
